## Simulations of Silicon Radiation Detectors for High Energy Physics Experiments 

Silicon radiation detectors are an integral component of current and planned collider experiments in high energy physics. Simulations of these detectors are essential for deciding operational configurations, for performing precise data analysis, and for developing future detectors. In this white paper, we briefly review the existing tools and discuss challenges for the future that will require research and development to be able to cope with the foreseen extreme radiation environments of the High Luminosity runs of the Large Hadron Collider and future hadron colliders like FCC-hh and SPPC.

##  Time Resolution of the 4H-SiC PIN Detector 

We address the determination of the time resolution for the $$\rm 100~\mu m$$ 4H-SiC PIN detectors fabricated by Nanjing University (NJU). The time response to $$\rm \beta$$ particles from a $$\rm ^{90}$$Sr source is investigated for the detection of the minimum ionizing particles (MIPs). We study the influence of different reverse voltages, which correspond to different carrier velocities and device sizes, and how this correlates with the detector capacitance. We determine a time resolution $$\rm (94\pm1)~ps$$ for $$\rm 100~\mu m$$ 4H-SiC PIN detector. A fast simulation software, termed RASER (RAdiation SEmiconductoR), is developed, and validated by comparing the waveform obtained from simulated and measured data. The simulated time resolution is $$\rm (73\pm 1)~ps$$ after considering the intrinsic leading contributions of the detector to time resolution.

##  Timing Performance Simulation for 3D 4H-SiC Detector

To meet the high radiation challenge for detectors in future high-energy physics, a novel 3D 4H-SiC detector was investigated. Three-dimensional 4H-SiC detectors could potentially operate in a harsh radiation and room-temperature environment because of its high thermal conductivity and high atomic displacement threshold energy. Its 3D structure, which decouples the thickness and the distance between electrodes, further improves the timing performance and the radiation hardness of the detector. We developed a simulation software---RASER (RAdiation SEmiconductoR)---to simulate the time resolution of planar and 3D 4H-SiC detectors with different parameters and structures, and the reliability of the software was verified by comparing the simulated and measured time-resolution results of the same detector. The rough time resolution of the 3D 4H-SiC detector was estimated, and the simulation parameters could be used as guideline to 3D 4H-SiC detector design and optimization.
