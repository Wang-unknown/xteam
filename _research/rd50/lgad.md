## Leakage Current Simulations of Low Gain Avalanche Diode with Improved Radiation Damage Modeling 

We report precise TCAD simulations of IHEP-IME-v1 Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) calibrated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Our setup allows us to evaluate the leakage current, capacitance, and breakdown voltage of LGAD, which agree with measurements' results before irradiation. And we propose an improved LGAD Radiation Damage Model (LRDM) which combines local acceptor removal with global deep energy levels. The LRDM is applied to the IHEP-IME-v1 LGAD and able to predict the leakage current well at -30 $$^{\circ}$$C  after an irradiation fluence of $$ \Phi_{eq}=2.5 \times 10^{15} ~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$$. The charge collection efficiency (CCE) is under development.

## Characterization of the first prototype NDL Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) 

Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) are silicon particle sensors with intrinsic gain through a thin p-type multiplication layer inserted between n-type implant and p-type bulk. The first prototype of LGAD sensors in China have been developed at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of Chinese Academic Sciences and the Novel Device Laboratory (NDL) of Beijing Normal University. With an active thickness of 33 Âµm, good breakdown performance, gain > 10, these sensors have reached jitter contribution of 10 ps to timing resolution with laser tests.

## Beam test results of NDL Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) 

A High-Granularity Timing Detector  (HGTD) is proposed based on the Low-Gain Avalanche Detector  (LGAD) for the ATLAS experiment to satisfy the time resolution requirement for the up-coming High Luminosity at LHC  (HL-LHC). 
We report on beam test results for two proto-types LGADs  (BV60 and BV170) developed for the HGTD. Such modules were manufactured by the Institute of High Energy Physics  (IHEP) of Chinese Academy of Sciences  (CAS) collaborated with Novel Device Laboratory  (NDL) of the Beijing Normal University.
The beam tests were performed with 5 GeV electron beam at DESY. The timing performance of the LGADs was compared to a trigger counter consisting of a quartz bar coupled to a SiPM readout while extracting reference SiPM by fitting with a Gaussian function. The time resolution was obtained as 41 ps and 63 ps for the BV60 and the BV170, respectively.

## Radiation effects on NDL prototype LGAD sensors after proton irradiation 

We study the radiation effects of the Low Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) sensors developed by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) and the Novel Device Laboratory (NDL) of Beijing Normal University in China. These sensors have been irradiated at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) using 100 MeV proton beam with five different fluences from 7$$\times10^{14}\rm n_{eq}/cm^2$$ up to $$4.5\times10^{15}\rm n_{eq}/cm^2$$. The result indicates that the effective doping concentration in the gain layer decreases with the increase of irradiation fluence, as expected by the acceptor removal mechanism. By comparing data and model gives the acceptor removal coefficient $$\rm c_{A} = \rm (5.52\pm0.58)\times10^{-16} cm^2$$, which shows the NDL sensor has fairly good radiation resistance. The time resolution of the sensors after irradiation was measured at $$(-30 \pm2)^{\circ}C$$.

## Design of Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) with 400 keV ion implantation energy for multiplication layer fabrication 

Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) are silicon sensors that can achieve a time resolution of better than 20 ps. The ATLAS and CMS experiments are designing LGAD detectors to address the pile-up challenge at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) has recently developed two versions of LGAD sensors. The LGAD sensors were designed using Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations and optimized to obtain high breakdown voltage and a suitable gain. The n-type Junction Termination Extension (N-JTE) and p-type gain layer are two critical structures for LGAD sensors that were investigated. IHEP has tuned the fabrication process of two foundries to obtain the most promising design. The first version of the IHEP LGAD sensor, with a gain higher than six and breakdown voltage higher than 400 V, was submitted to Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor Company for fabrication. The second version of the LGAD sensor benefits from the higher implantation energy available at the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) to reach a gain higher than ten and breakdown voltage higher than 420 V.

## Design and fabrication of Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD): a TCAD simulation study 

Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) are silicon sensors with a time resolution better than 20 ps. The ATLAS and CMS experiments are designing LGAD detectors to address the pile-up challenge at the High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) High-Granularity Timing Detector group has recently developed its first version of LGAD sensors. The LGAD structure was designed using Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations and optimized to obtain a high breakdown voltage and ideal gain. The n-type Junction Termination Extension (N-JTE) zone is a critical structure to guarantee a high breakdown voltage. The gain layer is optimized for an ideal gain factor and hence good time resolution. The optimized LGAD sensor has a gain higher than six and a breakdown voltage higher than 400 V.

## Radiation hardness of the low gain avalanche diodes developed by NDL and IHEP in China 

This paper studies the radiation hardness of low gain avalanche detector (LGAD) developed by the Novel Device Laboratory (NDL) in Beijing and the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the context of an upgrade project of the ATLAS detector for the high luminosity phase of LHC. NDL LGAD sensors with different layouts, epitaxial resistivity and doping profile were irradiated up to $$1.02\times10^{15} n_{eq}/cm^2$$ by 70 MeV protons at Cyclotron and Radioisotope Center (CYRIC). The timing resolution of NDL LGAD sensors reached 50 ps and the collected charge reached 3 - 4 fC after irradiation.

## Radiation Campaign of HPK Prototype LGAD sensors for the High-Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD)

We report on the results of a radiation campaign with neutrons and protons of Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) produced by Hamamatsu (HPK) as prototypes for the High-Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) in ATLAS. Sensors with an active thickness of 50~$$\mu$$m were irradiated in steps of roughly 2$$\times$$ up to a fluence of $$3\times10^{15}~n_{eq}/cm^2$$. As a function of the fluence, the collected charge and time resolution of the irradiated sensors will be reported for operation at $$-30^{\circ}C$$.
