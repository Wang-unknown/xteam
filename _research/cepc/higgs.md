##  Physics potential for the H$$\rightarrow ZZ^{*}$$ decay at the CEPC

The precision of the yield measurement of the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of $$Z$$ bosons process at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is evaluated. Including the recoil $$Z$$ boson associated with the Higgs production (Higgsstrahlung) a total of three $$Z$$ bosons are involved for this channel, from which final states characterized by the presence of a pair of leptons, quarks, and neutrinos are chosen for the signal. Two analysis approaches are compared and the final statistical precision of $${\sigma}_{\mathrm{ZH}}{\cdot}$$BR($$H \rightarrow ZZ^{*}$$) is estimated to be 6.9% using a multivariate analysis technique, based on boosted decision trees. The relative precision of the Higgs boson width, using this $$H \rightarrow ZZ^{*}$$ decay topology, is estimated by combining the obtained result with the recision of the inclusive $$ZH$$ cross section measurement.

## Search for invisible decays of the Higgs boson produced at the CEPC

The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) proposed as a future Higgs boson factory will operate at a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV and accumulate $$5.6 ab^{-1}$$ of integrated luminosity in 7 years. In this paper, we estimate the upper limit of BR($$H \rightarrow$$ inv) for three independent channels including two leptonic channels and one hadronic channel at the CEPC. Based on the full simulation analysis, the upper limit of BR($$H \rightarrow$$ inv) could reach 0.26% at the 95% confidence level. In the Stand Model (SM), the Higgs boson can only decay invisibly via $$H\rightarrow ZZ^\ast\rightarrow\nu\overline{\nu}\nu\overline{\nu}$$, so any evidence of invisible Higgs decays that exceeds BR($$H \rightarrow$$ inv) of SM will indicate a phenomenon that is beyond the SM (BSM). The invariant mass resolution of visible hadronic decay system $$ZH(Z \rightarrow qq$$, $$ H \rightarrow$$ inv) is simulated and the physics requirement at the CEPC detector to reach this is given.
