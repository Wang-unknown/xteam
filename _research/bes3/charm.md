## Charm Physics at BESIII 


BESIII collected the world largest data samples of 2.93, 0.482 and 0.567 $$fb^{-1}$$ data at 3.773, 4.009 and 4.6 GeV, respectively. Based on these data samples, BESIII perform some analyses of $$D^{0(+)}$$, $$D_s^+$$ and $$\Lambda^+_c$$, which are important to understand the weak decay machanism of charmed mesons and baryons. The leptonic decays of $$D^+\to\tau^+ \nu_{\tau}$$ and $$D^{+}_{s} \to \ell^+ \nu_{\ell}$$ are measured. The dynamics of $$D^+\to \bar{K}^0 e^+ \nu_e$$, $$\pi^0 e^+ \nu_e$$ and $$K^{-}\pi^+ e^+ \nu_e$$ are studied, and the parameters of the form factors and CKM matrix elements \|$$V_{cs(d)}$$\| are extracted. In addition, the branching fractions for $$D^+ \to \bar{K}^0 \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$$, $$\bar{K}^0 e^+ \nu_e$$, $$D^+_s \to \eta^{(\prime)} e^+ \nu_e$$ are also provided. The amplitude analysis of $$D^0\to K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$$ is performed. The asymmetries of $$D^+\to K_{S/L}K^+(\pi^0)$$ and $$D^0\to K_{S/L}\pi^0(\pi^0)$$ decays are measured. The ranching fractions for $$D^+\to 2K_S K^+$$, $$2K_S\pi^+$$, $$D^0\to 2K_S$$, $$K_S$$ as well as $$D^{0(+)}\to$$ other 14 channels of PP final states are determined. Finally, the measurement of the Singly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays $$\Lambda_c^+\to p \pi^{+} \pi^{-}, pK^+K^{-}$$, the Cabibbo-favored decays of $$\Lambda^+_c\to\Sigma^-\pi^+\pi^+(\pi^0)$$ have been obtained.
