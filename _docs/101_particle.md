## Beyond Standard Model

With the discovery of Higgs particle <sup>[1]</sup> , a complete set of particle physics system based on the standard model has been improved, which can explain all the observed particles and interactions. But in the process of exploring the universe, people gradually realize the existence of dark matter and dark energy, and have a strong interest in it. 

In the process of human exploration of the universe, a series of studies on galaxies, galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background show that our universe is a flat universe that is accelerating expansion <sup>[4, 5]</sup> . But in theory, the gravitational pull between matter in the universe prevents it from expanding all the time, unless there is other dark matter or dark energy. According to the observation data, we found that dark energy accounts for the majority of the universe, about 70\%, followed by dark matter, accounting for 27\% of the total energy density <sup>[6]</sup>. Dark matter is considered as a hypothetical particle, which does not participate in electromagnetic interaction, but in gravitational interaction. The interaction between dark matter and all known basic forces in the standard model is very weak, or even not at all. Therefore, the study of dark matter has become one of the hot spots in today's physics <sup>[7, 8, 9]</sup> . As for what dark matter is, one hypothesis holds that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps), which can hardly be detected by detectors. The experiments on LHC can be used to find the detectable wimps related to the final state, and to limit the generation of low-quality wimps <sup>[11, 12]</sup> . In the experiment, the search for dark matter is usually to study the lost energy in the large Collider, and judge the possibility of the existence of dark matter by comparing with the theoretical calculation of neutrino final state in the standard model. This experimental method has higher requirements for the detector.
